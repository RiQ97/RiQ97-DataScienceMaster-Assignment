    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. Flask Framework is a lightweight and micro web framework for Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Flask provides the essential tools to get a web application up and running and leaves the choice of additional components to the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight: Minimalistic and easy to set up, making it a good choice for small and simple applications.\n",
    "2. Flexible: Provides a lot of control to developers, allowing them to build applications the way they want.\n",
    "3. Modular: Flask's modular design allows for easy integration with other libraries and frameworks.\n",
    "4. Extensible: Can be extended with Flask extensions to add more functionality as needed.\n",
    "5. Community Support: Has a strong community and excellent documentation, making it easier to find support and resources.\n",
