    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1:Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows us to create and manage multiple processes within a single thread. This module is a part of the Python standard library and provides a way to perform parallel execution by using separate memory spaces for each process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main advantage of using multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: It allows us to run multiple tasks simultaneously, making full use of multiple CPUs or cores.\n",
    "Efficiency: It helps to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, which is a limitation for CPU-bound tasks in multithreading.\n",
    "Resource Utilization: Better CPU utilization for compute-intensive tasks.\n",

    "1. Multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: Each process has its own memory space.\n",
    "GIL: Does not have Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) issues since each process is independent.\n",
    "Overhead: More overhead due to creating separate memory space and context switching between processes.\n",
    "Use Case: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: Threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "GIL: In CPython, the GIL can be a bottleneck because it allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "Overhead: Less overhead compared to multiprocessing as threads share the same memory.\n",
    "Use Case: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
