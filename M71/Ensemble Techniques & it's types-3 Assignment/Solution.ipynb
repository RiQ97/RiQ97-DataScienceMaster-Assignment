    "### Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees. This technique is based on the concept of bagging, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is the aggregate of the predictions of all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by:\n",
    "- **Averaging Predictions:** Since it averages the predictions of multiple trees, it smooths out the noise from individual models, reducing the overall variance.\n",
    "- **Random Subsets:** Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data (bagging) and a random subset of features, ensuring that the trees are less correlated with each other. This diversity among the trees helps the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Regularization:** The process of random feature selection (where each tree only considers a random subset of features for splitting) acts as a regularization technique, preventing any single tree from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. In Random Forest Regressor, the final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions from all the individual decision trees. For regression tasks:\n",
    "- **Averaging:** The predictions from all trees are averaged to give the final prediction. This averaging helps to reduce variance and improve the overall accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. Key hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "- **`n_estimators`:** The number of decision trees in the forest.\n",
    "- **`max_depth`:** The maximum depth of each tree.\n",
    "- **`min_samples_split`:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "- **`min_samples_leaf`:** The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "- **`max_features`:** The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "- **`bootstrap`:** Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.\n",
    "- **`random_state`:** Controls the randomness of the estimator, useful for reproducibility.\n",
    "- **`max_samples`:** If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. **Overfitting:** Decision Tree Regressors can easily overfit to the training data, especially when deep trees are allowed. Random Forest Regressor mitigates overfitting by averaging the results of multiple trees.\n",
    "- **Prediction:** A Decision Tree Regressor gives a single prediction based on the learned tree, while a Random Forest Regressor averages the predictions of multiple trees.\n",
    "- **Stability:** Random Forest is more stable and robust to noise and changes in the dataset compared to a single Decision Tree, as it reduces variance.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** Random Forest is computationally more expensive and harder to interpret than a single Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A6. **Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Reduced Overfitting:** By averaging multiple trees, Random Forest reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Handles Missing Data:** It can handle missing data effectively by using the majority rule in splitting.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** It is efficient for large datasets and high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance:** It provides insights into feature importance, which helps in feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Computational Cost:** It is computationally expensive, especially with a large number of trees and features.\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** The model is less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Over-Complexity:** If not properly tuned, it can become unnecessarily complex without significant gains in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A7. The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous value that is the average of the predictions from all the individual decision trees in the ensemble. This value represents the predicted value for the regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "A8. Yes, Random Forest can be used for classification tasks, but in that case, it is referred to as a **Random Forest Classifier** rather than a Regressor. The principles remain the same, but instead of averaging the outputs (as in regression), the final prediction is made by majority voting among the trees for classification. Each tree votes for a class, and the class with the most votes is chosen as the final prediction."
