    "\n",

    "  Example: For the data [2, 5, 8, 10], the range is \\(10 - 2 = 8\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance**: The average of the squared differences from the mean. It gives more weight to outliers and provides a measure of how data points spread out from the mean.\n",
    "  Example: For the data [2, 5, 8, 10], the variance can be calculated using \\(\\frac{\\sum (x - \\bar{x})^2}{n}\\).\n",

    "\n",
    "A8. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset. It indicates whether the data points are skewed to the left (negative skew) or to the right (positive skew).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. If data is right-skewed, what will be the position of the median with respect to the mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "A9. If data is right-skewed, the mean will be greater than the median. This is because the long tail on the right side pulls the mean towards higher values.\n",

    "### Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "A10. **Covariance**: Measures the degree to which two variables change together. It can be positive (both variables increase together) or negative (one variable increases as the other decreases).\n",

    "\n",
    "A13. **Covariance**: Measures the degree to which two variables change together. It is not standardized and can take any value. Positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase together, while negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase as the other decreases.\n",
    "**Correlation**: Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is standardized to range between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship. Correlation is a scaled version of covariance.\n",

    "A14. Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",

    "- **Mean**: Outliers can skew the mean, making it higher or lower than the central value of the bulk of the data. For example, in the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the mean is 22, which does not represent the central tendency of most data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Median**: Outliers have little effect on the median because it is based on the middle value. For the same dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the median is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode**: Outliers generally do not affect the mode, as it is the most frequent value. For the dataset [1, 1, 2, 3, 100], the mode is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range**: Outliers increase the range, making it less representative of the spread of the majority of the data. For the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the range is 99.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Outliers increase these measures, indicating greater dispersion. For the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the variance and standard deviation are much higher compared to a dataset without the outlier.\n"
